# Automated test of missing missing meta and alt tags

Run script with 'npm run check' and you will be prompted for the dev site url.

Once added in, the script will auto-create a sitemap.xml and use that to d/l each page.

The pages are checked for missing alt tags and content attributes in meta tags. 

Once the checks are done you will get a simple report as an html file.

The report contains the url with the problems, and the html elements themselves for easy search and replace in your code :)
