# create a sitemap and run some tests on meta and alt tags

Run script with 'npm run check' and you will ne promoted for the dev site url

Once added in the, the script will auto-create a sitemap.xml and use that to d/l each page

The pages are checked for missing alt tags and meta. Once the checks are done you will get a simple report as an html file

This contains the page / url with the problems and the html elements themselves for easy search and replace in your code :)
